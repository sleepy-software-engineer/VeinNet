    VeinNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)â€“based system for palm vein identification. The approach begins by extracting the palm region of interest (ROI) from a dataset of multispectral hand images, focusing on the vein patterns within this ROI as input to the CNN. Trained on these hand images, VeinNet demonstrates the ability to effectively recognize unique vein patterns in the human palm. The system is evaluated using three distinct types of evaluations: identification with a closed set, identification with an open set, and verification. The dataset is split differently for each evaluation setup, ensuring that the system is tested under various conditions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of VeinNet in identifying individuals based on their palm vein patterns, with promising performance metrics across all evaluation setups.
