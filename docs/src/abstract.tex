    VeinNet is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)â€“based system for palm vein recognition. The approach begins by extracting the palm region of interest (ROI) from a dataset of multispectral hand images, focusing on the vein patterns within this ROI as input to the CNN. Trained on these hand images, VeinNet demonstrates the ability to effectively recognize unique vein patterns in the human palm. The system achieves a 90\% accuracy on the test dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of a CNN-based solution.
